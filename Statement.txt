Bullet point all the gameplay features.

The player is given a task list of at least three different things they want to do daily 
The player also sets time limits of each task and is given 30 minutes to come back to the game and check off the ongoing tasks they set
Based on the amount of time it took to fulfill that task, the player receives some points to spend on equipment for the plant. (min time 10 minutes, max 5 hours)
The plant needs sufficient amounts of water, sunlight, and quality soil that the player would have to provide by buying them from the store.
The plant will grow if its needs are met and will eventually leave for its home planet and a new one will replace it
If the plant is not taken care of it will be sad and die
